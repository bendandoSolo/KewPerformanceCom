His holistic approach to my overall wellbeing has motivated me to go to the gym on the off days and tailored my diet and regime to meet my individual needs. For anyone who works long hours but wants better work/life balance I would certainly recommend one-to-one sessions with Leon. </p>

        <div class="tQuote"><p class="tQuoteP">Leon's approach is high energy and his sessions are always fun, no matter how hard they get! Leon has never taken a 'cookie-cutter' approach to my training, but always personalises each session to what works best for me. Leon always pushes you to produce your best, but he also applies some 'common sense' to your training, he won't blindly make you do 'ten reps' of something, when it’s clear that you're working as hard as possible and can only do six. Leon recently motivated me to step into the boxing ring for a white-collar boxing fight. He trained me every step of the way - physically, technically and mentally. I've never been in better shape. What a great experience!  I've trained with Leon for nearly five years now, and have referred many friends to him, as he's got to be one of the best personal trainers out there.</p>

He got me in the best shape of my life whilst creating a programme that also stabilised a long standing back injury. You can’t really ask for more. It’s just a shame he is an Arsenal fan, but I guess you can’t have everything.</p>

        <div class="tQuote"><p class="tQuoteP">Three things make Leon unique vs other trainers I've used. Firstly his broad and comprehensive knowledge of several different types of training (which he is frequently doing courses to keep his knowledge up to date).Secondly, his ability to adapt and mold sessions to every individuals needs and goals. Finally, Leon's personal experience in sport, and continued intense training he puts himself through. This, combined with the constant courses on training and nutrition that he does, gives me comfort that you are being trained by someone know knows what they are talking about, and also knows what you are going through during and post the sessions.
